## MineGit
Project will provide a version control system, simular to git, for a minecraft worlds

MineGit operates independently of the game, working directly with Minecraft world files to enable efficient versioning and backups

Program should allow players for easy backup of their worlds and restore through CLI, git or simular existing programs wont be used for this part

During restoring user will be able to specify specific regions(part of the world) that will be restored, by default all regions will be restored 

## Requirements
For our project to be successful, it should:
- without damaging them
- Support committing current changes
- Provide rollback capabilities to restore previous versions
- Allow to specify specific regions to be restored
- Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for managing world versions

## Compatibility
Supports: Minecraft: Java Edition 1.12.2+
Not Guaranteed: Compatibility with other Minecraft editions and older versions

MineGit will use Rust programming language
Through this project, we hope to learn about efficient data storage, Rust-based file operations, and how to handle binary world files effectively
