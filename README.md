## Introduction
Managing Minecraft worlds can be challenging. There is no built-in way to track changes, revert to previous versions, or merge different edits. Our project aims to solve this by creating a Git-like version control system for Minecraft worlds, allowing users to commit, branch, merge, and rollback changes efficiently. Through this project, we hope to learn about efficient data storage, Rust-based file operations, and how to handle binary world files effectively.

## Requirements
- For our project to be successful, it should:
- Track changes made to Minecraft world files.
- Support committing, branching, and merging world changes.
- Provide rollback capabilities to restore previous versions.
- Offer a simple command-line interface (CLI) for managing world versions.
