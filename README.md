Program w'ont work directly with a game, instead it will only work with world files
Program should allow players for easy backup of their worlds and restore through CLI, git or simular existing programs wont be used for this part
During restoring user will be able to specify specific regions(part of the world) that will be restored, by default all regions will be restored.

## Requirements
For our project to be successful, it should:
- Track changes made to Minecraft world files.
- Support committing, branching, and merging world changes.
- Provide rollback capabilities to restore previous versions.
- Offer a simple command-line interface (CLI) for managing world versions.

MineGit will use Rust programming language
Through this project, we hope to learn about efficient data storage, Rust-based file operations, and how to handle binary world files effectively.
